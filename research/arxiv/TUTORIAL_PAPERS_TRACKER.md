# Tutorial Papers Tracker

**Source:** https://speculative-decoding.github.io/

**Purpose:** Track all papers from the speculative decoding tutorial that need to be summarized

**Status:** 📋 Waiting for search quota reset (February 1, 2026)

---

## Action Plan

When search quota resets, visit https://speculative-decoding.github.io/ and:

1. Extract all paper listings from the tutorial
2. Categorize by paper type (token-level, feature-level, multimodal, etc.)
3. Cross-reference with existing summaries
4. Create summaries for missing papers
5. Update this tracker with completion status
